Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups in history. Their hiatus saw Beyoncé's theatrical film debut in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwB0ZJbwmpw" target="_blank"><i>Austin Powers in Goldmember</i></a> (2002) and the release of her debut album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerously_in_Love" target="_blank"><i>Dangerously in Love</i></a> (2003).

	<h1 id="toc1">Early Life</h1>

	<p>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine &quot;Tina Knowles&quot; (née Beyincé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager. Beyoncé's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name. Beyoncé's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former back up dancer for Destiny's Child. <b><i>Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had No. 1 albums.</i></b>

	</figure>
	<p>Beyoncé attended St. Mary's Montessori School in Houston, where she enrolled in dance classes. Her singing talent was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes. Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon" target="_blank">John Lennon</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(John_Lennon_song)" target="_blank">&quot;Imagine&quot;</a> to beat 15/16-year-olds. In fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school's choir. She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and later Alief Elsik High School. Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church as a soloist for two years.</p>
	<p>When Beyoncé was eight, she and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.</p>
	<p>In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&amp;B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.</p>

	<h1 id="toc2">Destiny's Child</h1>

	<p>The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the <i>Book of Isaiah</i>. In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song "Killing Time" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black. The following year, the group released their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny%27s_Child_(album)" target="_blank" self-titled debut album></a>, scoring their first major hit &quot;No, No, No&quot;. The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&amp;B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&amp;B/Soul Single for &quot;No, No, No&quot;. The group released their Multi-Platinum second album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Writing%27s_on_the_Wall" target="_blank"><i>The Writing's on the Wall</i></a>  in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills&quot;, the group's first number-one single, &quot;Jumpin' Jumpin'&quot; and &quot;Say My Name&quot;, which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. &quot;Say My Name&quot; won the Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&amp;B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide. During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song &quot;After All Is Said and Done&quot; for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, <i>The Best Man</i>.

	<p>Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. Beyoncé experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause. Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time. The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything. Beyoncé stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and she feared no one would take her seriously. Beyoncé would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it. Franklin was dismissed, leaving just Beyoncé, Rowland, and Williams.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>The remaining band members recorded &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie%27s_Angels_(film)" target="_blank"><i>Charlie's Angels</i></a> . It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks. In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen:_A_Hip_Hopera" target="_blank"><i>Carmen: A Hip Hopera</i></a>, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. </p>
	<p>When the third album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(Destiny%27s_Child_album)" target="_blank"><i>Survivor</i></a> was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. The album spawned other number-one hits, &quot;Bootylicious&quot; and the title track, &quot;Survivor&quot;, the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. After releasing their holiday album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_Days_of_Christmas" target="_blank"><i>8 Days of Christmas</i></a> in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.</p>

"Telephone" received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.</p>
	<p>Beyoncé announced a hiatus from her music career in January 2010, heeding her mother's advice, "to live life, to be inspired by things again".</p>

	<p>On February 6, 2016, Beyoncé released "Formation" and its accompanying music video exclusively on the music streaming platform Tidal; the song was made available to download for free. She performed "Formation" live for the first time during the NFL Super Bowl 50 halftime show. The appearance was considered controversial as it appeared to reference the 50th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party" target="_blank">Black Panther Party</a> and the NFL forbids political statements in its performances. <b><i>This performance had racists S H O O K.</i></b> Immediately following the performance, Beyoncé announced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Formation_World_Tour" target="_blank">The Formation World Tour</a>, which highlighted stops in both North America, and Europe. It ended on October 7, with Beyoncé bringing out her husband Jay-Z, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar" target="_blank">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams" target="_blank">Serena Williams</a> for the last show. The tour went on to win "Tour of the Year" at the 44th American Music Awards. <img id="formation" src="http://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2016/02/beyonce-formation-super-bowl-2916-gif.gif"></p>
	<p>On April 16, 2016, Beyoncé released a teaser clip for a project called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_(Beyonc%C3%A9_album)" target="_blank"><i>Lemonade</i></a>. It turned out to be a one-hour film which aired on HBO exactly a week later; a corresponding album with the same title was released on the same day exclusively on Tidal. <i>Lemonade</i> debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making <b><i>Beyoncé the first act in Billboard history to have their first six studio albums debut atop the chart</i></b>; she broke a record previously tied with DMX in 2013. With all 12 tracks of <i>Lemonade</i> debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, <b><i>Beyoncé also became the first female act to chart 12 or more songs at the same time.</i></b> Additionally, <b><i>Lemonade was streamed 115 million times through Tidal, setting a record for the most-streamed album in a single week by a female artist in history</b></i>. It was 2016's third highest-selling album in the US with 1.554 million copies sold in that time period within the country as well as the best-selling album worldwide with global sales of 2.5 million throughout the year.</p>
	<p>Lemonade became her most critically acclaimed work to date, receiving universal acclaim according to Metacritic, a website collecting reviews from professional music critics. Several music publications included the album among the best of 2016, including Rolling Stone, which listed Lemonade at number one. The album's visuals were nominated in 11 categories at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, the most ever received by Beyoncé in a single year, and went on to win 8 awards, including Video of the Year for "Formation". The eight wins made Beyoncé the most awarded artist in the history of the VMAs (24), surpassing Madonna (20). Beyoncé occupied the sixth place for Time magazine's 2016 Person of the Year.</p>

	<p>In January 2017, it was announced that Beyoncé would headline the Coachella Music and Arts Festival. This would make Beyoncé only the second female headliner of the festival since it was founded in 1999. It was later announced on February 23, 2017 that Beyoncé would no longer be able to perform at the festival due to doctor's concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she will instead headline the 2018 festival. Upon the announcement of Beyoncé's departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%.</p>
	<p>At the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017, Lemonade led the nominations with nine, including Album, Record, and Song of the Year for Lemonade and "Formation" respectively and ultimately won two, Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade and Best Music Video for "Formation". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele" target="_blank">Adele</a>, upon winning her Grammy for Album of the Year, stated Lemonade was monumental and more deserving.</p>
	<p>On June 13, 2017, Beyoncé gave birth to twins Rumi and Sir Carter at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. </p>
	<p>In September 2017, Beyoncé collaborated with J Balvin and Willy William, and remixed the song "Mi Gente". Beyoncé donated all proceeds from the song to hurricane charities for those affected by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in Texas, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean Islands.</p>
